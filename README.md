# rkk-ros2-bridge

A ROS2 bridge for Rokoko SmartGlove solved-hand data. Early scaffold — no
functional code yet, just the environment and package layout to build on.

Runs natively against the system ROS2 install — no separate Python
environment/dependency manager. Minimal dependencies by design.

> **Note:** ROS2's Python bindings (`rclpy`, message
> packages, etc.) aren't distributed via PyPI — they only exist as part of a
> ROS2 distro install, made available by sourcing `/opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash`
> into the system Python. A `uv`/`venv` environment can't see those, so this
> package is meant to run against the system interpreter, not an isolated
> virtual environment. If isolation is ever needed (a clean environment, a
> different OS/distro version, CI), the right tool for that is a **Docker
> container** with ROS2 installed inside it — not a Python venv.

## Prerequisites

- **Ubuntu 26.04** (or whatever your ROS2 distro targets)
- **[ROS2 Lyrical Luth](https://docs.ros.org/en/lyrical/Get-Started/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html)**
  — follow the official Debian install guide. Heads up: `ros-lyrical-desktop`
  is a large install (hundreds of packages, a couple GB) — expect it to take
  a few minutes.
- **colcon** — not bundled with `ros-lyrical-desktop`, install separately:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
  ```
- **[Rokoko Device SDK](https://sdk.rokoko.com/)** — provides `rokoko-sdk`
  (the SmartGlove driver) and `rkk-hand-solver` (the hand solver), both of
  which this bridge connects to. See
  [Running the upstream chain](#running-the-upstream-chain) below.

## Repo layout

```
ros2_ws/
  src/
    rkk_hand_bridge/       # the (currently empty) ROS2 package
      package.xml           # marks it as an ament_python ROS2 package
```

`ros2_ws` is the colcon workspace root — packages live under `ros2_ws/src`,
and `colcon build` (once there's something to build) is run from there.

## Getting started

**Source ROS2** in any shell you work in (add this to your `~/.bashrc` if you
want it automatic in new terminals):

```sh
source /opt/ros/lyrical/setup.bash
```

That's it for now — there's nothing to build yet.

## Running the upstream chain

This bridge is a plain RGMP v2 client of `rkk-hand-solver`'s solved-hand
output — it needs exactly two other processes running, nothing more:

```sh
# 1. The SmartGlove driver. -ef 1024 enables experimental epoch timestamps,
#    which this bridge prefers when available (see the timestamp handling
#    in the design docs) — verify the exact flag name against
#    `rokoko-sdk --help` on your build, long and short forms can vary.
rokoko-sdk -vv --auto-stream-usb -ef 1024

# 2. The hand solver, attaching to the driver already running above.
#    --emit-openxr is the only group this bridge reads.
rkk-hand-solver --emit-openxr --no-driver
```

## Status

Nothing is implemented yet — this is just the scaffold: a valid ROS2 package
shell (`package.xml`). No source files, no dependencies beyond what ROS2
itself provides.
